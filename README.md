# My First Up Uploaded Github Repo!
 I will include some files from my CyberSecurity Bootcamp as a momento of some of the great things that I've learnt over the last few months.

## Some included files:
 - Bash Scripts written during introductory lessons
 - Yaml files written for Ansible to rollout onto Azure infrastructure
 - A diagram drawn on Draw.io of the Azure infrastructure I've built
